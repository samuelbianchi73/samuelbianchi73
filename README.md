## Hello, World! :)

I'm Samuel Bianchi!

- ðŸ«¤ Iâ€™m not very good at coding. I sometimes use Microsoft Copilot to make games in HTML, but I can't code.
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m collaborating with rcreator822 on some projects!
- ðŸ‘¾ I made a few games with Microsoft Copilot that are featured on [GamerHub](https://github.com/rcreator822/GamerHub), like MPS!
